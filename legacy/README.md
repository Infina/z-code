# Z Code

**Z Code** is the last AI-native IDE, the cockpit for **Francis Architecture**. Built upon the core of Roo Code, it has been evolved into a frictionless, multi-language aware development environment.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **Holographic Map**: A high-performance Rust engine that parses your codebase (Rust, TypeScript, Python) and identifies core structures using PageRank algorithms.
- **Zero Friction**: No mandatory cloud logins. Full privacy and local model support out of the box.
- **Francis-Native**: Specifically optimized to understand and build complex software architectures with a "Tao" philosophy.

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: `pnpm install`
2. **Build the Engine**: `pnpm run build` (This automatically compiles the Rust core)
3. **Launch Z Code**: Press `Fn + F5` in VS Code.

### 🏛️ Philosophy

Z Code represents the "Z-axis" (Depth) and the "Zero" (The Source/Tao). It is designed to be the ultimate vessel for AI and human collaboration.
